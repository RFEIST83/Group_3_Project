# Data Analytics Boot Camp - Group 3 - Project 1

## Race Results and Driver Performance Over The Years
 
### Group Members:

Himali Wijeratne, Alexander Hodgins, Rowan Feist, Shenae Pepper

### Description/Outline:

This project analyses Formula 1 race results and driver performances from 1950 â€“ 2023 to gain insights into the sport. By exploring the dataset, we will identify trends, patterns, and statistics related to race outcomes, as well as evaluate the performance of individual drivers over time. Through visualizations and analysis, we will present key findings and potentially uncover interesting facts about Formula 1 history.

### Research Questions:

**Do better qualifying results contribute to a more successful race? - Rowan Feist**

Using the dataset we attempted to make find the correlation between qualifying results and final race position in a race. We did this by comparing the qualifying results 26,080 starting positions with the mean of 15,207 race finishes for 857 different drivers. By mergeing the datasets together to get this information we then built a scatter plot to display the results. This showed some outliers in the data but still clearly showed a correlation between the two. To confirm this a linear regression was done which provided a result of 0.70. While not a regression of 1, with the amount of data analyzed and the unpredicictability of a Formula 1 race this still showed a very strong correlation between the two.
